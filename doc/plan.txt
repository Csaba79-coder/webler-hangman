Hangman plan:

- enter name (and capitalize first letter)
- generate word // in our case it is reading from array!
- choose random word from array
- draw underscores for each letter in the word
- define number of guesses // in our case 6 times -> 6 wrong guesses -> game over (draw hangman)
- ask a guess from user
- check if guess is in the word
    - if guess is in the word, replace underscore with letter
    - if guess is not in the word, add to wrong guesses (start drawing hangman)
- in our case, if you know the solution, guess letters by letters
